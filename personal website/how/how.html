            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 2;
            flex: 1 3">at the time of  making this website, i(the owner of this website, not the whole team) have around 1 month of experience in  web development, in html, css, and javascirpt, which is what this website is structered out off.</div>
            <br>
            
            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 3;
            flex: 1 3;">this website only uses basic css and html knowledge, if you have experience in those subjects, you could make something like this, but probally better becuase both people working on this website are 10, and when you do web development.</div>
            
            <br>
            
            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 4;
            flex: 1 3;">wee made this website using viewport and flexbox, to make sure the website works on any traditinal device (phones, tablets, computers, etc)</div>

            <br>

            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 5;
            flex: 1 3;">(at the time of writing of this, it is the first day of developing this website, so this might be changed soon) i use a ide called visual studio code, it is develeloped by microsoft, and it is a pretty good ide for web dev.</div>

            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 6;
            flex: 1 3;">here are some steps that we took to make this website, that we, and many others think are essential or at least very good to know:</div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 7;
            flex: 1 3;">1. learn html</div>

            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 8;
            flex: 1 3;">2. learn css</div>

            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 9;
            flex: 1 3">3. learn what viewport and flexbox/grids are</div>
            <br>
            <div>4. learn javascript</div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 10;
            flex:  1 3">5. use flexbox or grid with divs and spans to make your websites better for devices other then computers (like how i did that, and most web devs, if you want to test it, go on your ipad or phone)</div>
        
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 11;
            flex: 1 3">i started programming when i was 9(aka 2019), i programmed in the very mainstream laungage; python, but i got mad with my self, and i quit it.</div>

            <br>
            
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 12;
            flex: 1 3">so, fast forward around middle of 2020 may, and i was bored in quarintine, so i decided to look through my old python files, so i decided to search some editors up, found visual studio code,and i  downloaded it. </div>

           
           <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 13;
            flex: 1 3">alright, so let's fast forward around 4 months, to early september, when i started learning basic web development, in the form of html and css, after that, i made a few testing folders, made a few forms, and tested it.</div>

            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 14;
            flex: 1 3">so by this time, it is 3-qaurters through september, and i thought to get a real domain, not something only stored on my computer, so i asked my dad, he said yes, and i got to work on this website.</div>

            <br>
            <div>after that, in very late october, i got another person working on the website with me, so it is easier</div>
            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 15;
            flex: 1 3"><h1 id="#explain">why we made this website</h1></div>

            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 16;
            flex: 1 3"><b id="idblue">if you want context for this section you will want to read the paragraph above.</b></div>

            <br>

            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 17;
            flex: 1 3">i decided to make this website becuase i wanted to make a website public for the first time, and see the response, and if you are looking at this, well, misson sucsessful!</div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 18;
            flex: 1 3">the reason i was not motivated to work on my website, was becuase no one will be looking at it, so i decided to work on a public website, being this website.</div>
            <br>

            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 19;
            flex: 1 3">but since now i have this domain, i hope people will like it, also, i made this website to test responsive web design with viewport and media query, considering that to make a website, it should look good on all main devices.</div>
            <br>

            <div class="flexbox" style="order: 20;
            flex: 1 3">so in conclusion, i made this website, becuase i wanted to get a public website, and to see if there is a age boundry for earning money from programming</div>
