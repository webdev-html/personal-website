            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h1>why i chose this domain name</h1></div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">i chose this domain name becuase i thought it was pretty cool that a ten year old(like me) has the power to make a decent website from html and css, while still learning about it, and i think it is extremly helpfull that anyone can make a website from basic knowledge, and make the whole internet be able to see it to.</div>
            <br>
            this is why i chose the domian name; prodinprog.com. it stands for prodigy in programming, becuase i am a amature 10 year old web developer, who can still make a website and make money from it. </div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">i came to this name from a process of elimination, amatureinprog does not sound that good, beginnerinprog just sounds like someone else made the site and i am just running it, profinprog could be misunderstood as profeser in programming instead of profesinal, and also, i am not profesinal, and masterinprog would just be wrong, and prodigy just means a lot of skill at a young age, like the skill to make a full website using html and css,and with ads, you can  get some money, at only 10 years old, like me, or  bill gates, a programmer at 7, when programming was not even main stream, he was just extremly smart and launched microsoft, or mark zuckerburg, a net worth of 1 billion at 21. </div>
