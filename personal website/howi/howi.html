        <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h1>how we got to this point</h1></div>
        <br>
        <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">so, the advice we have for people getting into any sort of programming, it is that you should start small, yes, some people can make good websites at a young age(like this one), but starting on basic tags and basic styles will let you get to that point, instead of skipping tutorials, learn the basics of html and css, then learn how to make a domain and web hosting, and then make a decent website with ads, don't speed into things, and don't give up after something fails</div>
        <br>
        <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">another piece of adivce is; take breaks, and don't get mad at yourself for not doing enough work, you need to do enough work to satisfy yourself, but not too much, like, for example: on weekdays when i have online classes, i ussaly only have time to do 1 hour of programming, on friday, we have more time, because our shcedules ajusts, since fridays you can sleep a lot later then normal becuase the next day is a weekend, you get more work done, like how i get 30 minutes more work done on a friday then any other weekday, but on weekends, since i don't have school, i get about 2 hours of programming work in, so just program when you want, and ajust the time you program to match events, like if i have a zoom call with my friends at 2:00 pm, i would get a little less work done, becuase while i'm in the call, i don't program in the call, so just ajust your programming time with events in your life, and take breaks when you need to, it will make it easier.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">there is one last piece of advice for you, and that is to know, that programming and becoming good at it takes time, i have done 1 whole month of web development, while doing programming for 2 hours a day, but i still have not become that good at it, and that is ok, becuase the more you learn, the easier it gets to learn, and the more motivated you will get to learn.</div>
