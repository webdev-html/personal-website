            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h1>among us game review(by me)</h1></div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">among us is a game where the fine line between teamwork and betrayl is highlighted, and it is a lot of fun, and i recommend anyone to buy that game, but before you do, i'll review it, and tell you, should you really get ammong us?</div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">in among us, you can be a crewmate, or an imposter, the crewmates job is to survive, not get thrown off the ship, and finish their tasks before the imposter kills everyone, the imposters roll is to kill everyone, and presumbly take over the ship.</div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">when someone is killed by the imposter, and someone sees the body, they can do something called a report, what this does is that it makes everyone talk to each other, and see if anyone is acting suspicous, such as; saying that they were somewhere that they were'nt supposed to be in. then, the players vote on who it is based on people's sides of the conversation, such as: i was in the bottom left side of the ship, but someone else says that they were with them, in the middle of the ship, and this is where the teamwork and betrayl starts happening, the crewmates do not know if someone else is a crewmate, or imposter, so they will vote someone off the ship, if they were an innocent crewmate, the imposter gets the upper hand, becuase now the game can end faster, becuase there is 1 less person that can report bodys, and 1 less person needed to end the game through kills and false accusations.</div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">the imposter can also vent through places, but only the imposter, so if you see someone come out of a vent, you know that they are the imposter, so you have to get to the emergency button, but they could kill you at any moment, also, the crewmates do tasks, the more tasks complete, the less tasks they need to win the game, if every crewmate finishs all their tasks, the crewmates win, so if you are the imposter, you have to pretend to do tasks, and if someone sees you pretending, they will warn everyone else, and probally eject you from the ship, now, what is my opinion on this?</div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">i really like it, and it is extremly popular and fun, over 1 million people have downloaded it, one of those people, is me, and in my opinion, if you want a fun time with your friends, just call them and play this game together.</div>
