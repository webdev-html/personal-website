            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="
            flex: 1 3;">i started programming in may 2020(it is late september 2020 at the time of this webpage being made), then after 4 months, i learned html and css, and also responsive web design, so it is not easy to learn programming, but the more you do it, the better understanding you get of it, and the more you learn.</div>
