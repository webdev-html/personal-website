            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h1>about</h1></div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">i am a 10 year old web developer who has only 1 month of exprience in web developing, i know css, and html, so yeah, that is what this website is made of</div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h1>important info</h1></div>
            <br>

           
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">
                on this website, updates are made constantly, so you don't get bored, 
                and the things we usally add in updates are: book reviews for new books we'v read, and articles talking about info for programming, 
                and small tutorials made by us, so you can get started on programming in html yourself!
            </div>
        
            
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">buying from this website through amazon links earn us money, so if you want the product and want to support me(since web hosting costs money) do that, please, we would really like it</div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">another thing is that this is not a professinaly made website,it is made by 2 amature 10 year old web developers, not a 25 year old google employee that spent 15 years of his life studying front end web dev.</div>
            <br>

            
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">ok, that is all we got, we hope you enjoy this website, and it is enjoying for you in the future as well, bye!</div>
