        <p>
            the first thing you will need to see is the word you are looking for, and most of the time it will be a word that is related to programming(css, html, javascript, python, ect).
            <br>
            the second thing you need to know is that the word will be scrambled up(html becoming thml, javascript becoming tavajsipr, ect).
            <br>
            <br>
            the last thing you will need to know is that when you click on the correct scrambled word(i.e: you clicked tavajsipr when you needed to find a scrambled version of javascript),the word will become highlighted.
            <br>
            <br>
            another thing i need to tell you is that there are different levels of word search difficulty(i.e: level 1 can be the word css scrambled to scs, but level 5 can be javascript scrambled into tavajsipr).
            <br>
