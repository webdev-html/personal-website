            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h1>harry potter book review(by me)</h1></div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><b class="bold-exp">note: since harry potter is such a popular series and i don't want to spoil it, i'll just talk about the beginning, so this review will be shorter then normal</b></div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">i think harry potter is a worthy book to buy, i say this becuase when i read it, it was so good, the plot, the charcters, and the charcter arcs felt so nice and fused together, i also liked how they made villans in this book, instead of them killing a lot(other then the main villan, voldemort), some of them are annoying and cruel, so you just want to punch them in the face 40 times over.</div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">another thing i liked about it was the main charcter's arc, from a 11 year old boy who was abused every day, to a hero and savior of many people, from living under the stairs, to living as a skilled wizard, so i think you should buy this book, and if you do buy it, buy it from the amazon affaliate links below, i earn money if you purchase the  book from there, so if you want to support me without paying extra money, and want the product, buy it down below</div>
