            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><b class="bold-exp">the review of wings of fire has examples of stuff in wings of fire, but it does not spoil the main parts and it focuses on how charcters feel and the relationships in the book, and how i feel about the book, what the author could have done better, and what the author did well, so if you don't want minor spoilers, don't read this review, but all of my book reviews have minor spoilers, so if you want the book, just buy it from my website, i earn a commison from it everytime someone does buy a book from this website, so if you want to support me, you can do that.</b></div>
            <br>

            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><b class="bold-exp">if you are looking to buy the wings of fire books, read this article on it, it will help a lot on your choice.</b></div>
            
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h1>the prolouges in  the books(and my opinion on them)</h1></div>
            
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">so i think the guide at the start of the books for each of the dragon tribes(because wings of fire's protaginists are all dragons) is very forward and nice, and i think it highlights the important propertys of dragons, their queens, and the fighting abilitys you should look out for.</div>
            
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">wings of fire as a series has a lot of emotion in it, but where it really shines are the standerds for emotion in the books, since dragons often kill dragons, but humans don't, you will get suprised when there is ruthless killing and murder in the book, but it is a part of the books aspects and emotions, so i really like it for that, and also the fact that the standerds are very different, it gives a unique feel to it.</div>
            
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">the prolouges of the book are like any other prolouge, it hints to something important to the specific book that it's in, i.e: the book's purpose is to end a long war, and the prolouge of it is where the whole war began(this is an actual example from a wings of fire book), so in my opinion, the prolouges are just like any other prolouge, hinting at the premise of the book, but that does not mean i think the prolouges are bad, i just think they are nothing special about them i need to talk about.</div>
            
            <br>
            <div>a small downside of the books are that the prolouge in the first book(the first book being <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wings-Fire-Book-One-Dragonet/dp/0545349230/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1HACIAIRKT2GU&dchild=1&keywords=the+dragonet+prophecy&qid=1601470629&sprefix=the+dragonet+%2Caps%2C159&sr=8-1" target="blank_">the dragonet prophecy</a>) is pretty confusing, but almost every prolouge is confusing, but in my opinion, the prolouge is less confusing then most, becuase they have a guide about dragons before the prolouge, so whenever someone says, "skywing" or "icewing" you know what they are refrencing, so i think the prolouge of the first book is less confusing then most, but it is still pretty confusing, at least in my exprience.</div>
            
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h1>the first few pages</h1></div>
            
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">the first few pages of a book define your feelings on the book, if the first few pages are unintresting, you will probally not get the book, but the first few pages of the wings of fire books really indear you to the book, becuase there are more and more things added to the story, like getting intruduced to the characters, then the setting, the goal of the charcters, different perspectives, and the problem are all important things in creating a book, and the way the author made the first few pages of this book feels very smooth, like how you see the personalitys and compare them with other personalitys from the book, like a personality that is brave, bossy, fearless, and stubborn, contrasting with a kind, cunning, annoying, and careful personality, and the way the author did that, just felt very good, like sometimes, the two personalitys would be getting along and helping eachother, but other times they could be fighting, so i think the author did a very good job with the contrast of personalitys, and a very good job of using contrast of personalitys to get the reader hooked on to the story, and i am happy they did a good job on it, becuase otherwise, i would not have read such a great series.</div>
            
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">i love the first few pages of this book, becuase you see how you feel about certian characters, and how those characters feel about the other characters, and you build profiles on those charcters, and then it gets fun to guess what they will do in certian situations, and i think the author of wings of fire did a very nice job on doing this, becuase one of the people are extremly abusive, one is a coward, and one has been loyal to the wrong dragon, and it came with a price, but later in the arc, you learn why they are like this, and you learn why they made certian choices that they did, and i think the author did a well job at that becuase she combined those aspects with relationships with other dragons, and storys that were prequels that showed why it happened, so i think that the author did an extremly well job at the relationships, and understandings of them throughout the 5 books in the first arc.</div>
            
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h1>the plan</h1></div>
            
            <br>
            <div>in wings of fire, and almost every other chapter book, has a part of the story called a plan, like; escaping a mountian you have been imprisoned in(this is the plan for the first book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wings-Fire-Book-One-Dragonet/dp/0545349230/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1HACIAIRKT2GU&dchild=1&keywords=the+dragonet+prophecy&qid=1601470629&sprefix=the+dragonet+%2Caps%2C159&sr=8-1" target="blank_">the dragonet prophecy</a>) and i think the way they make the plans slowly cascade into the conflict is very good, like the example before, the dragons were trapped under a mountian, they escape, but they get imprisoned by someone who is extremly sadistic and violent(this is an actual thing in the first book, like, this actually happens), but i like how the author made the main conflict happen, instead of them being found and getting taken and imprisoned, they escape, go back into the mountian, and there a battle happens, and the transition from being caught to being in the prison feels smooth, and i would rate it a little better then average tranistions, becuase of the differences of what happened to the characters, becuase the abusive skywing gets imprisoned, the cowardly seawing flees, and the sandwing gets killed, so it shows there personalitys, and highlights them, the cowardly dragon flees, which makes sense, the abusive dragon who has lost too much gets take to prison, and the caring one gets killed, so the personalitys of the dragon imprisoning them is mixed with the dragons who are taken to prison, and it blends very well</div>

            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h1>the conflict</h1></div>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">i think the conflict of this book is quite normal, most of the conflicts in chapter books have a failed attempt before it, and then it works becuase of a character fixing it, and that's how wings of fire does most of their conflicts, the conflit happens, something/someone else gets in their way, and they get through that obstacle, and then they get through the main problem, so i think most of the conflicts are pretty average in wings of fire, it's not better then normal, but also it's not worse then normal.</div>
            <br>

            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h1>conclusion</h1></div>
            <br>
            <br>

            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">the conclusions/epilouges of the wings of fire books are like any epilouge, they hint at the following book, and to me, that seems ok, and it will sometimes hint to a subplot of the book, so in my opinion, the conclusions are average, and i like them.</div>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h1>final opinion</h1></div>

            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;">my final rating of the series is: 10/10. i hope you enjoyed listneing to this review, and if you want to buy any of the wings of fire books, they are in the links below, if you buy from those links, i earn some money, so if you want to support me, and not pay extra for the product, buy the books below, otherwise, i hope you enjoyed this review.</div>
