            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><p>
                a span is an html element that is meant to be used as a container for other html elements.
                <br>
                a span does nothing without it having a child element.

            </p></div>

            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h2>what does a span do to it's child element?</h2></div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><p>
                what a span does to it's child element is that it makes every one of it's child elements on the same line, at first that might sound completely usless, but it makes elements the are always seperated be next to each other.
                <br>
                note: p tags bypass a spans effect
                <br>
                <br>
                this will come in when you get into grids and flexbox, and for postitioning elements in your website.
                <br>
                <br>
                fun fact: divs and spans are opposites, but they are used for the same reasons, postitioning elements on a webpage, but divs are used more often, because their purpose is needed more often.
