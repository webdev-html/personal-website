            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><p>
                an iframe is basiclly the tag for basic embedding in html, and what it does it that adding the most important property of the iframe tag of "src", and setting that property to a valid webpage, in the webpage the iframe tag is on, it will make a small version of the webpage that your embedding.
                
            </p></div>

            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h2>when to use an iframe</h2></div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><p>
                you should use iframes for embedding videos, audio files, or just small parts of other website, like if your making a website all about harry potter, you could add an iframe of the author(j.k rowling) talking about harry potter.
            </p></div>

            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h2>propertys of iframes</h2></div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><p>
                the most important property of an iframe is the "src" property, and the reason it is so important is because it tells the iframe what to embed, such as google.com or something else.
                another important property of an iframe is the "border" property, and the reason it is so good for the iframe, is becuase since the iframe is just a box with something from another website in it, the border should look good, so that it stands out, it is not as important as telling the iframe the thing that it should embed, it is still good in modern web development to add a nice and clean border.
            </p></div>

            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h2>when have i used iframes?</h2></div>
            <br>

            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><p>
                for every article i make on this website, it requires an iframe, the reason being that if you don't understand one of my articles, i just record a video of me explaining it and giving you examples, i save it to google drive, then just make an iframe of it, for you to watch, like the video below on iframes(watch it if you are still confused on how iframes work)
