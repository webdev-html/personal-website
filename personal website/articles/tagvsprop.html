                a tag is a value that does something, that is surounded by less then and more then signs. some highly used tags are: img tags, h1 tags, p tags, and many more.
                <br>
                <br>
                a property on the other hand are values inside of tags that resemble a certian value for that tag, such as the property "src" for the img tag, in this case, the src propertie tells the img tag what's the web address of the thing you want to display as an image.
                <br>
                <br>
                all properties resemble something inside a tag, and some properties can be in different tags, for the same reason, like how in an iframe tag, src is the property that tells the iframe what it should embed, the same way it does for images, so that shows that properties are not specific to a tag.
                <br>
                <br>
                some highly used examples are: width for the width of something, height for the height of something, src for the directed path, and many more.

            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><h2>are there tags that need properties to work?</h2></div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3;"><p>
                the short answer, yes, but you'r here to get the information, so i'll tell you the long answer.
                <br>
                <br>
                a tag that is used a lot and needs properties to function is the link tag, because you have to tell it what you want to link it to, same with hyperlinks(a tags), images(iframes and img tags), and many more, because linking something to something else needs properties, so making a link or displaying images/videos/audio files will require that, and when you get more advanced in html, a lot more things will need classes and ids, which require properties(class= and id= respectivly) like on this website, where i use flexbox to make everything gridded properly, it requires me to say, "class="flexbox", which is a property.
