            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3 ;"><h2>what is a div</h2></div>
            <br>
            <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3 ;"><p>
                a div is an html element that does nothing without being a parent element to something else.
                <br>
                <br>
                i.e: 2 div tags next to each other with text inside them do nothing(exept display the text) without properties, but that can be said with any tag that displays text(p tags, h1-h6 tags, ect), but if there is another tag inside of the div, then the div actually functions.
                </p></div>
                <br>
                <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3 ;"><h2>what does a div tag do to it's child element?</h2></div>
                <br>
                <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3 ;"><p>
                    what a div tag does to it's child element is that it will make it's child element on a different line then normal, at first you might be asking questions like; "why don't you just add a breakline tag?", my answer to this question is that it is used for tags that are unaffected by breaklines, such as table tags.
                    the reason that this happens is because the div tag is a container tag, meaning that it only does stuff with another tag inside of it.
                </p></div>

                <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3 ;"><h2>when are divs used?</h2></div>
                <br>
                <div class="flexbox" style="flex: 1 3 ;"><p>
                    divs are used like mentioned above, for elements in html that are not affected by breaklines, but more commonly used as containers for other tags.
                    an example of div tags being used is on this website, this paragraph of text is a paragraph tag inside of a div tag, and a time the div tag was used on this site is usally for make sure tables are where their supposed to be, because tables are unaffected by breaklines, so i have to use a div to make sure the table is not on the top corner of some text, but on the bottom of the screen, like the homepage of this website, where the table of contents for this website is, i used a table inside of a div so that the table was properly placed, and that is seen all around websites, because divs are extremly important for containing elements in html.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    fun fact: divs and spans are opposites, but they are used for the same reasons, postitioning elements on a webpage, but divs are used more often, because their purpose is needed more often.
